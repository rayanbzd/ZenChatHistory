### THIS PLUGIN IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED SINCE 1.20.6 FIXED CHAT PERSISTENCE. PLEASE UPDATE TO 1.20.6+

### Description
ZenChatHistory is a plugin for [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/), a Minecraft proxy server. 
Since recent updates of minecraft (1.20.2), chat session is cleared on client side when changing backend server while using a proxy such as Velocity, Bungee, etc.
ZenChatHistory is a plugin that allows you to keep your chat history when changing backend server for client using 1.20.2 or higher.

### Dependency
To use ZenChatHistory, you need to have [PacketEvents v2.2.0](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents/releases/tag/v2.2.0) installed on your velocity proxy.

### Installation
To install ZenChatHistory, just drop the jar file in your `plugins` folder of your velocity proxy.
Builds can be found in the release tab of this project.
This plugin is only compatible with Velocity 3.3.0-SNAPSHOT.
I will make it compatible for other proxy servers in the future, such as BungeeCord or Waterfall.


### Compilation
ZenChatHistory is built with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). If you have it installed, just run
`./gradlew build` in the root project folder.
Then, you can find the compiled jar in `build/libs/`.
